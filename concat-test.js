// Unit Test

//A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. 

//It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

// it should give an error if output is even

// Function Test

// Expect concatOdds([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) the result should yield [1,3,5,7]
// Expect to use a for loop to loop through each index

// Using example "concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])", result would be [-1, 1, 3,9,15] the result should yield one number if there are multiple 
// same number in an array, it should only print 1 since they are the same nested array

// Expect "concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])" result yied [2,4] this will be error because we only want odd
